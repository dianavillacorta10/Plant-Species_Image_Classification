# Plant-Species_Image_Classification

1. How did the number of images per class affect your model’s accuracy?
   Increasing and balancing the number of images per class generally improves model accuracy and performance
2. Which plant species were most commonly misclassified and why?
   Species from the same genus (for example, similar mangrove species like Rhizophora types) are often misclassified because their leaves      and structures look almost identical in images.
3. How did changing the epochs, batch size, or learning rate affect the training results?
   Proper tuning of epochs, batch size, and learning rate is important. A balanced combination improved accuracy and stability, while poor     parameter choices led to underfitting, overfitting, or unstable training.
4. What challenges did you encounter during dataset collection and labeling?
   collecting clean, balanced, and accurately labeled data was one of the most challenging parts of the project.   
5. If you were to improve your model, what specific changes would you make and why?
   To improve the model, I would increase and balance the dataset, apply data augmentation, tune hyperparameters, use a pretrained model,      and remove low-quality images. These changes would help improve accuracy, reduce overfitting, and make the model more reliable.
